# Software-Engineer-Exercise-N.5
Fifth Exercise for Software Engineering:
Small programm that allow a client to rent for a car, and to give it back once used. It also allow to see which cars are free to use and put an extra fee if the client 
gave the car back after the written date.
I learnt to focus more on the class diagram and sequence diagram, and I think I finally understand what the job of a Software Engineer trully is about.
